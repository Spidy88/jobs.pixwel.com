# Contributing

To contribute to this repo, please fork the project and create
a feature branch. Commits should be small and organized. Squash
and reorganize commits with messages like "testing something" or
"fixing again". Make the messages specific.

Once you've completed your work, run the linter.

```
npm run lint
```

If the linter passes, open up a pull request to the master branch
on this repository. PRs do not need to be squashed but the commit
history should be organized. Accepted PRs will be merged as soon as
possible.

Thanks for wanting to contribute!
